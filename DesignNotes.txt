Next up: Make it much easier to return to the overview map done!

Next after that: Airport Maps icon

		self.navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent;
and
		self.navigationController.navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyleDefault;

make for some interesting effects, but getting them to appear and disappear more challenging than you think! Also, they tend to hide (yet you can see) part of the map or table when translucent bar already in place (as opposed to changing
on rotation).

Note that unit tests builds do NOT catch missing files that have been removed until a "clean" is done.
